# _Class Sign-In_

##### _Allows students to sign in and out of class and allows teachers to view who is present/absent, as well as expel students on a whim, 9/25/2015_

#### By _**Jordan J. Johansen**_

## Description

_On the main page the user is asked to identify themselves as either a student or a teacher by clicking the corresponding button.  Students are taken to a page where they are able to sign themselves in.  When they do so, the page dynamically updates to replace the "Sign In" button next to their name with a "Sign Out" button.  Clicking the "Teacher" button on the main page (or the "Who's here?" link at the top of each page), takes the user to a page displaying two lists of students: one displays students are currently signed in (i.e. "Present"), and the other displays students that are not signed in (i.e. "Absent").  This list also updates dynamically whenever a student signs in or out.  The teacher can also decide to "expel" students for absolutely no reason whatsoever._
